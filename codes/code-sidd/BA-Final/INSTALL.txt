# == INSTALLATION ==
#
# You can either install DBAT by downloading the source code or (if
# you use a git client) by cloning the repository.
#
# === Download ===
#
# 1) Download the package file dbat-master.zip (from the main page) or
#    dbat-x.y.z.w.zip/dbat-x.y.z.w.tar.gz (from the releases page) of
#    https://github.com/niclasborlin/dbat/
#
# 2) Unpack the file into a directory, e.g. c:\dbat or ~/dbat.
#
# === Clone ===
#
# At the unix/windows command line, write:
#
#   git clone https://github.com/niclasborlin/dbat.git
#
# to clone the repository into the directory 'dbat'. Use
#
#   git clone https://github.com/niclasborlin/dbat.git <dir-name>
#
# to clone the repository to another directory.
#
# If you use a graphical git client, e.g., tortoisegit
# (https://tortoisegit.org), select Git Clone... and enter
# https://github.com/niclasborlin/dbat.git or
# git@github.com:niclasborlin/dbat.git as the URL.
#
#
# ==== Download high-resolution images ====
#
# To reduce the size of the repository and hence download times, only
# low-resolution images are included in the repository. High-resolution 
# images can be downloaded from http://www.cs.umu.se/~niclas/dbat_images/.
# For further details, consult the README.txt files in the respective
# image directories.
#
#
# == TESTING THE INSTALLATION ==
#
# 1) Start Matlab. Inside Matlab, do the following initialization:
# 1.1) cd c:\dbat % (change to where you unpacked the files)
# 1.2) dbatSetup  % will set the necessary paths, etc.
#
# 2) To test the demos, do 'help dbatdemos' or consult the manual.
#
#
# == UPDATING THE INSTALLATION==
#
# === Git ===
#
# If you cloned the archive, updating to the latest release is a
# simple as (replace ~/dbat and c:\dbat with where you cloned the
# repository):
#
#   cd ~/dbat
#   git pull
#
# at the command line. In TortoiseGit, right-click on the folder
# c:\dbat, select Git Sync... followed by Pull.
#
# === Download ===
#
# If you downloaded the code, repeat the download process under
# INSTALLATION. Most of the time it should be ok to unzip the new
# version on top of the old. However, we suggest you unzip the new
# version into a new directory, e.g. dbat-x-y-z-w, where x-y-z-w is
# the version number.
#
