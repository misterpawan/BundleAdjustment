These a re domain decomposition codes. 
Given a matrix, it exploits the domain decomposition of the natrix, and builds a Schur complement based solvers.
Main Test File: test_DDM.m
The main test file requires the matrix file (get matrices from Siddhant) and right hand side (create random right hand side)
